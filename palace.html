return to the ancient catacombs</a>

When you emerge from the tunnel, you find
yourself in a great hall. Magnificent stone
pillars hold up a vaulted ceiling, upon
are masterfully painted murals. The massive
windows on the sides depicts scenes of
historical significance in the yellow,
red, and orange stained glass. Your
upward gaze reveals one of the most
beautifully built structures you have seen.
You lower your gaze.
Debris is on the ground in every direction
around the hole in the floor. A trail of
a dense, dried fluid the color of a
midnight sky leads toward a grand set of
steps leading to an enormous and broken
door. Along the way to the steps are dozens
of bodies. Unlike the bodies you have seen
elsewhere, these ones are adorned in
intricate and thick armor, with clean or
broken weapons in their grips. Many are
missing limbs or heads, others have
puncture wounds large enough to throw
a rock through. As you begin to climb
the steps, you draw your sword from
within your coat, expecting a fight.
You reach the top and enter the doorway,
ready for battle.
The throne room is large, but smaller than
the hall before. It is dark in the room,
with moonlight from the full moon shining
in from a few of the windows. Large, dark
blue growths wrapped themselves around
structural columns, walls, and windows
like brine and barnacles attaching to
the hull of a ship. All of the growths
lead to a mass in the center of the room.
There lay an enormous creature, with
chitinous plates covering its upper body.
It has six arms, like those of a praying
mantis. Its lower body was like a slug
made of the material covering the walls.
It rests there, motionless and dead. You
sheath your sword, and turn around to
leave. There is nothing more you can do
for this city beyond figuring out what
happened, and warning others of their
mistake.
