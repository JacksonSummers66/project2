You are a wandering mercenary.
Long ago, you set off from your home and
elected to wander the world, offering
your skills as a tracker and warrior to
those who can afford.
It has been weeks since you have seen
civiliztion, but at long last, you are
nearing your destination. Adorned in your
longcoat, with blade and light armor
concealed by dark, worn leather, you
reach the crest of a hill. Before you
lies the grand city of Actaeonia. In
this city of scholars, workers, and
craftspeople, there is surely an
abundance of work.
But even from the distance you stand
at, something is certainly wrong. The
walls appear in disrepair, silence sits
on the air, and dark pillars of smoke
rise from within the walls.
It would be easy to simply walk away, but
something compells you to push forward.
To enter the city and find out what
has gone awry. Regardless of whether the
pursuit of wealth, concern for others, or
some greater force, you move
forward nonetheless.
