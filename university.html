Return to the city streets</a>

You enter the university to find it in
complete disarray. Books and paper are
scattered around in the library where
you entered. Your boots make the old
wooden floors of the building creek as
you move through the library. You
approach a desk in the center of the
room with a body slumped over a book,
a quill in their hand. The book looks
normal at first glance, but upon closer
examination, you find that it is written
in a bizarre language. In the center of the
writing is a symbol: an eye surounded by
dark tendrils.
Continuing to explore the buidling, you
find the bodies of more scholars, all of
which were apparently absorbed in their
studies until the very end. You climb the
stairs in the center of the room and
arrive at an open door to an office.
You enter the office.
The office walls are lined with bookshelves,
organized neatly, unlike the rest of the
building. A large, beautifully carved 
desk occupies the left side of the room.
On it are numerous opened books, with a
large one occupying the center. On the
opened pages is an illustration of a
large creature with a body that lacks a
definite form, like a fleshy sludge.
Where the body begins to taper, it begins
to look like a giant insect. 
There is a comfortable leather chair sat
beside a lit fireplace. On the mantle,
you notice a small protrusion with a
symbol of an eye with tendrils. You push
the protrusion and the fireplace slides to
the right, revealing a lift with a lever.
