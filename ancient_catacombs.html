Enter to the abandoned mines</a>

The blue fire of the wall mounted torches
reflects off of the smooth stone of the
catacomb walls as you proceed down the
corridor. You notice an alcove to your
right, and through it, an open area carved
out by mining tools and explosives that
extends upward into comlete darkness.
On the left side of the room is a crank
attached to a system of pulleys that lead
up the shaft. At the top, you can just
barely make out a wooden platform.
A lift.

Back in the corridor you came from, you
procede until you reach an enormous chamber
lit by sconces and dangling braziers.
The room is octagonal, with massive stone
arches on each wall. In the center lies
a giant rectangular sarcophagus. Around
it are several pulleys and weights tied
to a massive slab of stone suspended above
the tomb. Scattered around the base of the
sarcophagus are burnt, charred bodies and
some sort of dark blue residue.
You step forward from the doorway and in
an instant, all of the blue flames in
the chamber are extinguished. After a
heartbeat, they reignite in familiar
orange fire.
On the other side of the room, blocked
by the sarcophagus until you walked
around it, is a large hole with a wake
of dirt and stone on the ground. Beyond
it, a tunnel dug at an incline and a light
at the top.
Something had dug its way out.
