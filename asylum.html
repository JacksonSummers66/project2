return to the ruined streets</a>

The interior of the building is not in
much better shape than the exterior. The
corridor you're in is a scene of utter
chaos. Blood stains cover the walls and
medical gurneys are everywhere and
in varying states of disrepair. Metal doors
line the sides of the hall at 2 meter
intervals, but the vast majority of
doors have been forced open, with deep
scratches in the metal, not unlike the
claw marks on the wooden surfaces of
the hall.
As you procede down the hall, you observe
the bodies around the building, and note
that they are dressed in medical garbs.
From further down the hall, you hear a
voice. It is faint and barely perceptible,
but is coming from a room with an intact
door. You peer inside through the barred
opening in the door, and see a person,
hunched over and shaking in the middle
of a sparse room. Around them are symbols
and words which make no sense to you are
etched into the floors and walls. The words
they utter are as unfamiliar as the symbols
surrounding them. They are extremely thin,
and their hair is thinning in places, as
though it had been torn out.
You open the door slowly and enter the room
but they pay you no mind. As you near them,
the sounds they utter sound as though they
are weeping. You reach out slowly to touch
their shoulder. Before you touch them,
they turn around with unexpected swiftness
and pounce on you. Their face is white and
their eyes too large, with no discernable
iris or pupil. You draw a dagger concealed
in your boot and stap the mad person in the
chest. As they begin to go slack, their
face shifts from blind rage to what almost
looks like relief. After a moment, you rise
to your feet and exit the room and go down
to the end of the hall. You open the door
at the end and find yourself looking out
at the entrance of a mineshaft.
