As you plunge into the darkness of the mine,
you notice a club handle sticking out of
a bucket of oil. You pull it out and find
that the submerged end is wrapped in cloth.
A torch. Scraping your dagger against the
stone walls, you create sparks to ignite
the torch. With the torch lit, the shaft
now glowed with the warm red-orange hue
of flame.
The mineshaft is mostly empty. You
occasionally pass a minecart loaded not
with ore or coal, but with simple stone.
Further down the way, you see a body at the
edge of the light cast by the torch. The
body looks as though it were crawling away, 
and has a pickaxe embedded in it's back. In
its right hand, it is tightly gripping a
large clump of hair.
As you go deeper into the mine, these
scenes of frantic violence become more
frequent, until you emerge into a cavern.
The area is massive. Natural columns of
stone appear to hold the cave ceiling up,
and around them are stockpiles of discarded
tools and wooden scaffolding. Your gaze
shifts to back of the cavern.
Embedded in the wall of stone is a stone
structure unlike any you have ever seen.
The stone of the structure is shiny and
smooth with a slight blue tint, like that
of lapis lazuli. In the center of blue
stone wall is a hole surrounded by scorch
marks and debris. As you approach, you
swear you see the stone pulse briefly
with dim blue light the color of lightning.
Peering into the breach, you see a corridor
carved from a similar material, albeit
seemingly older, with sconces of eerie
blue flame lighting the way.
