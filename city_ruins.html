<a href="hub.html">Return to the cathedral</a>

The street before you is cracked and
covered with stone debris. The waterway
adjacent to the street is the crimson of
blood, broken only by a floating body or
or chunks of stone that have fallen in.
All along the streets and the bank of the
water are the bodies of humans and large
humanoid creatures with large eyes the color
of pearls. Arrows protrude fromthe bodies
of the creatures, others have bladed weapons
and sharpened workers tools embedded in
them.
The aftermath of the battle is seen all 
along the street as you move forward.
Eventually you come across a bridge over
the bloodied river, connecting to a sturdy
structure built into the wall of the city.
The windows of the buidling are covered by
metal bars, but have been bent open. The
iron door at the end of the bridge is
bent and scratched, with the metal bending
outward. One side of the door is hanging on
by a single hinge.
