<h1>Actaeonia Streets</h1>
<a href="hub.html">Return to the cathedral</a>

As you step out onto the streets of
Actaeonia, you are met with an assault
on the senses. The air reeks of burnt meat
and smoke, the crackling sounds of fire
are more pronounced, and the light from
the midday sun is blinding as you emerge
from the relative darkness of the cathedral.
You press on.
Walking down the street, you see the
aftermath of what could only be described
as madness. Many of the fires you saw from 
atop the hill are evidently from the
bonfires strewn around the streets. On
these fires you can make out the charred
remains of a person. Other bodies can be
found in the gutters, most showing signs
of large cuts. Other bodies, however, were
much different. These corpses were humanoid
in nature, but could easily have been two
to three meters in height. Their torsos and
limbs were elongated, and their bodies
marked by protrusions of sharp bone and
razor sharp talons.
After a while, You come to a city square
with numerous crucifixes erected in the
center. Affixed to the crucifixes are
more of creatures. You see ones face and
note their gnarly teeth and large, pure
white eyes. To the left of square, the
ground had given way and the debris of the
house that once stood there scattered
about the street below.

You continue down the road for an hour,
and arrive at a gate at the end of the
road, with a large, intricate, stone
building just beyond. A sign on the gate
reads "Actaeonia University".
