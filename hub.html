On your approach to the city, the lack
of people and the silence became more
evident. The path to the main gate was
without sound, save for the occasional
animal sounds or window shutters being
blown around by wind. Curiously, despite
the lack of people in the outer city,
there is also a lack of corpses.
As you near the gate, you look to your left
and see a bridge over a chasm, leading to
a small mining settlement adjacent to
the city.

Go to the mining settlement</a>

You get to the gates of the city,
but are surprised to find that the gate is
slightly ajar, just enough to walk through.
Expecting to enter a large outdoor common
area, you find yourself in what appears
to be a cathedral. The room you're in is
large, with two doors on either side of
the great hall. The room is lit by hanging
lanterns, as well as numerous candles.
In the center lies a shrine, and around it
are numerous bodies, kneeling and in
varying states of decay. The door to your
right leads out onto the streets of the
city. Down the road, you see numerous
bonfires and corpses.

The door to the left leads out onto a
similar street, but this one is noticebly
more run down and decrepit. The buildings
are scorched and crevaces have formed
in the pavement.
