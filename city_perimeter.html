Entering the mining settlement, you notice
a significant contrast to the inside of the
walls. The inner city has grand stone
structures with intricate masonry, neat
stone roads, and neat glass in the windows.
This settlement is not at all as ornate.
The buildings are cobbled together from
mismatched stones, with shoddy wooden
scaffolding around them. Several rooftops
are damaged or simply nonexistent. Much
like the approach to the city, you notice
a lack of bodies. The paths and buidlings
alike are completely empty.
You come across a building which a sign
identifies as being used for the storage
of mining equipment. Inside, racks for
tools and boxes of explosives line every
wall and create seperate isles in the
middle of the room. Curiously, you note
that all of the racks and boxes are
empty.
Back outside, you continue along the
main road until you reach the entrance
to a mine. Around the entrance are mounds
of dislodged stone, minecarts full of
scorched rock and broken pickaxes, and
countless boxes of mining explosives. 
The ground by the entrance is extremely
weathered, with so many bootprints and
footprints that it is difficult to
identify any single print. You look
into the mine, and a feeling of dread
consumes you.
